<p><span>Gosh the first time</span> that i remember being behind a camera i was about the young age of 8, i had been playing in my grandmothers attic when i came across a dust old full of polaroids and film, well i spent hours just looking at the old photos in amazement i had never known my grandfather but just looking at those photos made me feel like i was right there next to him. And thats when i came across my grandfathers camera it was an old nikon.</p>
<p>Well i ran downstairs and asked my grandmother more about photography, she told me all about cameras and the rest is history.<p>

<p><span>A camera is like a window</span> to a person's soul, i think thats why i enjoy photographing people who are just going about with their everyday life whether they are at the grocery store or just going for a walk. Its so innocent. Its so true. Any one can spend month planning an expensive photo shoot with the most fancy clothes and prettiest models they can find but no thats not life, thats pretend.</p>
<p>The people i photograph ,are everyday people, these people have nothing to hide, they're just trying to make a living and go about life one day at a time. And i think that's beautiful</p>

<p><span>My dream job</span> would be to tour the world and shoot for geographic magazine.</p>
